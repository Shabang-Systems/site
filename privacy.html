                    <h2>Cookie Policy</h2>
                        <p>Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal memory.</p>
                        <p>This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app may use third party code and libraries that use “cookies” to collect information, provide their service (such as authentication preservation), and improve their services. You have the right to either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose to refuse our cookies, parts or all of the Service cannot function.</p>
                    <h2>Data Security</h2>
                        <p>We value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
                    <h2>Selling Data</h2>
                    <p>We believe that your data is yours alone, and that we do not have the right to profit off of it. We will not sell any user data to third parties under any circumstance. </p>
